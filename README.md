# rgs2srg
[Fork updated for Gradle 7.5.1] rgs2srg (formally mappings-gen) - Converts rgs mappings to srg mappings. 

This tool is going to be used in the RCP process. It is 7 years old so I forked it and updated the Gradle wrapper to 7.5.1. I wasn't intending on updating beyond that, but some bugs forced me to.

99.99999% of credit for this goes to jamierocks.
